# CSS Task

Welcome in the CSS Flexbox task.

## For your information

You don't need to set widths and heights exactly the same as it is in the screenshot below, this task is about how you

### If you still want to do this, these are useful information about the project:

colors: `goldenrod, lightpink`

sizes: `50px`

container-width: `300px`

padding: `10px`

## Your task

You need to create styles in external `style.css` file (you can't touch HTML). Your result should look like this:
